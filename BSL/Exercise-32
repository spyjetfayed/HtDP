;Exercise 32. Most people no longer use desktop computers just to run
;applications but also employ cell phones, tablets, and their carsâ€™ informa-
;tion control screen. Soon people will use wearable computers in the form of
;intelligent glasses, clothes, and sports gear. In the somewhat more distant
;future, people may come with built-in bio computers that directly interact
;with body functions. Think of ten different forms of events that software
;applications on such computers will have to deal with.

Desktops - There are hundreds if not thousands of events going on in a desktop computet. The
mouse click or keyboard events, timer showing the time, different netowork protocols.
bio computers - Heartbeat monitoring, temperature monitoring, sending the data to netoworks.

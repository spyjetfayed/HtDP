;Exercise 31. Recall the letter program from chapter 2.3. Here is how
;to launch the program and have it write its output to the interactions area:


(define (letter fst lst signature-name)
  (string-append
   (opening fst)
   "\n\n"
   (body fst lst)
   "\n\n"
   (closing signature-name)))
(define (opening fst)
  (string-append "Dear " fst ","))
(define (body fst lst)
  (string-append
   "We have discovered that all people with the" "\n"
   "last name " lst " have won our lottery. So, " "\n"
   fst ", " "hurry and pick up your prize."))
(define (closing signature-name)
  (string-append
   "Sincerely,"
   "\n\n"
   signature-name
   "\n"))

(write-file
 'stdout
 (letter "Matthew" "Fisler" "Felleisen"))
